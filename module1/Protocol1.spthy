/* In the following, we will indicate action facts you need to annotate your rules with.
   The variable names used in the facts are arbitrary, you may of course choose your own names, 
   as long as you refer to the same entities. 
   For example, we indicate you should annotate the first rule with the action fact:
   RegisterPassword(C,S,pwd)
   An annotation with different variable names and sort prefixes: RegisterPassword($A,$B, ~passcode) is also valid.  */
